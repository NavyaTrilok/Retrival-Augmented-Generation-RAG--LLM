A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application is a software architecture that combines a Large Language Model (LLM) with a vector database to enhance the accuracy 
and relevance of LLM responses by augmenting them with context-specific information

I have built a POC here using pytorch. I have used a text file that has data on pizza.

The steps every RAG application follows -

Ingesting

Chunking

Embedding

Indexing and Storing

Retrieving

Generating
